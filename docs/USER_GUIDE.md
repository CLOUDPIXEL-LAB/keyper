## 🚀 Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

When you first open Keyper, you'll see the **Migration Wizard** that guides you through setting up encryption:

1. **Welcome Screen**: Shows your current credential statistics
2. **Create Master Passphrase**: Set up your encryption passphrase
   - **New Users**: Get the simplified bcrypt-only authentication system with secure emergency reset capabilities
   - **Existing Users**: Legacy wrapped DEK system maintained for backwards compatibility
3. **Confirm Passphrase**: Verify your passphrase was entered correctly
4. **Migration Review**: Review credentials that will be encrypted
5. **Migration Progress**: Watch as your credentials are encrypted
6. **Setup Complete**: Your vault is now ready!

### Choosing a Strong Passphrase

Your master passphrase is the key to all your encrypted data. Choose wisely:

✅ **Good Examples:**

- `MySecure!Keyper2025#Vault`
- `Coffee&Donuts@Midnight42!`
- `Purple$Elephant#Dancing99`

❌ **Avoid These:**

- `password123`
- `keyper`
- `123456789`
- Your name or birthday

**Passphrase Tips:**

- Use 15+ characters for best security
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid keyboard patterns (qwerty, 123456)
- Make it memorable but unique
- Never share it with anyone

## 🔐 Using the Vault

### Unlocking Your Vault

## 📝 Managing Encrypted Credentials

### Creating New Credentials

1. **Click "Add Credential"** from the dashboard
2. **Choose Security Level**:
   - 🔐 **Encrypted** (recommended): Data encrypted before storage
   - ⚠️ **Plaintext**: Data stored without encryption
3. **Fill in Details**:
   - **Title**: Descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub API Key")
   - **Type**: API Key, Login, Secret, Token, or Certificate
   - **Username**: Account username (if applicable)
   - **Secret Data**: The sensitive information to encrypt
4. **Add Metadata**:
   - **URL**: Associated website or service
   - **Category**: Organize your credentials
   - **Tags**: Additional labels for searching
   - **Notes**: Additional context or instructions
   - **Expiration**: Optional expiry date — check **"No expiration"** next to the date field for credentials that never expire (e.g., logins, permanent API keys)

### Viewing Encrypted Credentials

**Credential Cards** show:

- 📋 **Title and Type**: Quick identification
- 🏷️ **Category and Tags**: Organization labels
- 🔐 **Encryption Status**: Green shield (encrypted) or orange warning (plaintext)
- ⏰ **Last Updated**: When credential was modified

**Security Indicators:**

- 🛡️ **Green Shield**: Encrypted with Argon2id or PBKDF2
- ⚠️ **Orange Warning**: Stored as plaintext
- 🔒 **Lock Icon**: Vault must be unlocked to view

### Revealing Secret Data

1. **Click on a credential** to open details
2. **Unlock vault** if locked (red lock icon appears)
3. **Click the eye icon** 👁️ to reveal secret data
4. **Auto-hide timer** starts (30 seconds default)
5. **Copy button** 📋 appears for easy copying

**Security Features:**

- **Auto-hide**: Secrets automatically hide after 30 seconds
- **Copy protection**: Clipboard cleared after copying
- **Activity tracking**: All access logged for security

## 🔄 Migration & Compatibility

### Migrating Existing Data

If you have plaintext credentials, Keyper can encrypt them:

1. **Migration Wizard**: Appears automatically when needed
2. **Review Credentials**: See what will be encrypted
3. **Start Migration**: Click "Start Migration" to begin
4. **Progress Tracking**: Watch real-time progress
5. **Completion**: All credentials now encrypted

**Migration Features:**

- ✅ **Safe Process**: Original data backed up during migration
- 🔄 **Batch Processing**: Multiple credentials encrypted together
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates
- ❌ **Rollback**: Emergency rollback if needed (reduces security)

### Mixed Environments

Keyper supports both encrypted and plaintext credentials:

- 🔐 **Encrypted**: Secure, requires vault unlock
- ⚠️ **Plaintext**: Less secure, always accessible
- 📊 **Statistics**: Dashboard shows encryption percentage
- 🎯 **Recommendations**: Suggests encrypting plaintext data

---

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Daily Usage

**DO:**

- ✅ Lock your vault when stepping away
- ✅ Use strong, unique passphrases
- ✅ Keep your browser updated
- ✅ Monitor failed login attempts
- ✅ Regularly review stored credentials

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Share your master passphrase
- ❌ Use Keyper on untrusted devices
- ❌ Leave vault unlocked unattended
- ❌ Store your passphrase in other apps
- ❌ Use weak or common passphrases

### Backup & Recovery

**Important**: There is no passphrase recovery!

**Backup Strategy:**

1. **Export encrypted data** regularly
2. **Store backups securely** (encrypted storage)
3. **Test restore process** periodically
4. **Document your passphrase** securely (offline)

**If You Lose Your Passphrase:**

📖 **Don't Panic!** For users with the new bcrypt-only system, you can securely reset your master passphrase. See our comprehensive [Emergency Passphrase Reset Guide](./EMERGENCY_PASSPHRASE_RESET.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

**For Legacy Users:**

- 🚨 If you're using the older wrapped DEK system, encrypted data becomes permanently inaccessible if you lose your passphrase
- 🔄 You must start fresh with a new passphrase
- 📋 Re-enter all credentials manually
- 🛡️ This is intentional for maximum security

**Migration Recommendation:** Consider migrating to the new bcrypt-only system for improved passphrase reset capabilities.
